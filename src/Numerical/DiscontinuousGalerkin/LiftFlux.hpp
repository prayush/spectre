/// \brief Lifts the flux contribution from an interface to the volume.
///
/// The lifting operation takes the (d-1)-dimensional flux term at the
/// interface and computes the corresponding d-dimensional term in the
/// volume. SpECTRE implements an efficient DG method in which each
/// interface grid point contributes only to that same grid point of the
/// volume.
///
/// \details
/// SpECTRE implements a DG method with a diagonalized mass matrix (also
/// known as a mass-lumping scheme). This choice gives a large
/// reduction in the computational cost of the lifting operation, however,
/// the scheme is slightly less accurate, especially when the grid is
/// deformed by non-trivial Jacobians. For more details on the
/// diagonalization of the mass matrix and its implications, see Saul's
/// DG formulation paper, especially Section 3:
/// https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01190.
///
/// \note The result is still provided only on the boundary grid.  The
/// values away from the boundary are zero and are not stored.
